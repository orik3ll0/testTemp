# 1)
#   lists and tuples are declared in different ways.
#       *List is square brackets []
#       *Tuple with parenthesis ()
# 2) 
#   Mutable vs. Immutable
#       *List is mutable - we can change/modify the values
#       *Tuple is immutable - we can NOT change/modify the values
# 3) 
#    If we have a large number of elements tuple is faster than list, because of size differences. List is the larger size than tuple.
